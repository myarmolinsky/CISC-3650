    /*there are three ways to apply html to css: inline, internal, and external
    inline is directly inside an html tag by using its style property
    internal is by making a style tag inside the html like the one this comment is in and putting css inside it
    external is by making a .css file and making a style tag inside the html file which gets linked to the html file like this:
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />*/
  </style>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../CSS/style.css" />
  <script src="../JavaScript/script.js"></script>

    <!--<p> tag puts everything inside it into a paragraph separate from other tags on the same layer as it-->
    <!--<strong> tag makes the text inside it bold-->
    <!--<em> tag makes the text inside it italicized-->
    <!--<br /> skips a line and it is a self closing tag-->
    <!--heading tags are h1-h6, h1 being the biggest heading and h6 the smallest.
        the text that goes inside is treated as a heading-->
    <!--<ul> tag is for unordered lists which use bullet points, <ol> is for ordered lists which use numbers.
        inside either of those tags, <li> tags are used to define each list item-->
    <!--<a> tags are anchor tags.
        give them an href property set to a link in quotes and clicking on the text inside the tags will take you to the site-->
    <!--<img /> is an image tag. it is selfclosing and you give the property of src set to a link or directory to load a picture.
        you can also give it properties of height and width to adjust the height and width of the give picture-->
    <!--<table> makes a table.
        inside the table tags you use <tr> to make table rows, inside which you make data cells with <td>
        <th> is for table headers-->
    <!--<form> is the form tag.
        it will contain <input> tags which would be given various types depending on the info the take in
        the types for input tags are:
        "text" which is for standard text
        "password" which keeps the characters hidden
        "checkbox" which creates a checkbox which can be toggled ("checked" can follow this type property to check it by default
        "radio" is like "checkbox" except only one input with type "radio" can be selected per group of "radio" type inputs
        "submit" is a button which will submit the form
        (giving an input with "submit" for the type property a value property will set the button's text to the text in the value-->
    <!--<textarea> creates a large multiline text area with a given amount of rows and columns
        (as provided in the properties via "rows" and "cols" properties respectively)
        the user may resize it and any text put inside the tag will be inside it by default for the user to overwrite-->
    <!--<select> tag uses <option> tags inside it to give the user options
        upon submission of the form, the option the user chose will be the one submitted
        an option can be made the default option by putting "selected" in the first half of the tag-->
    <!--forms have a action and method property
        the action property is where you put where to submit the data to
        the method property is where you put how you would like to submit the data (post, get, delete)-->
    <!--Submitting a form refreshes the page-->

    <div id="second" class="second">This is the second div tag</div>
    <div id="third" class="third">This is the third div tag</div>
